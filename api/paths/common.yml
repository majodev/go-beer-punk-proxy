        This endpoint returns 200 when the service is ready to serve traffic.
        Does read-only probes apart from the general server ready state.
        Note that /-/ready is typically public (and not shielded by a mgmt-secret), we thus prevent information leakage here and only return `"Ready."`.

        This endpoint returns 200 when the service is healthy.
        Returns an human readable string about the current service status.
        In addition to readiness probes, it performs actual write probes.
        Note that /-/healthy is private (shielded by the mgmt-secret) as it may expose sensitive information about your service.
