## 2021-03-15
### Changed
- Upgrades `go.mod`:
  - `github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/v4@v4.5.0`
  - `github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal@v1.8.0`
  - `golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210314154223-e6e6c4f2bb5b`
  - `golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20210314195730-07df6a141424`
- Seeding: Switch to `db|dbUtil.WithTransaction` instead of manually managing the db transaction. *Note*: We will enforce using `WithTransaction` instead of manually managing the life-cycle of db transactions through a custom linter in an upcoming change. It's way safer and manually managing db transactions only makes sense in very very special cases (where you will be able to opt-out via linter excludes). Also see [What's `WithTransaction`, shouldn't I use `db.BeginTx`, `db.Commit`, and `db.Rollback`?](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/FAQ#whats-withtransaction-shouldnt-i-use-dbbegintx-dbcommit-and-dbrollback).

### Fixed
- The correct implementation of `(util|scripts).GetProjectRootDir() string` now gets automatically selected based on the `scripts` build tag.
  - We currently have 2 different `GetProjectRootDir()` implementations and each one is useful on its own:
    - `util.GetProjectRootDir()` gets used while `app` or `go test` runs and resolves in the following way: use `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` (if set), else default to the resolved path to the executable unless we can't resolve that, then **panic**!
    - `scripts.GetProjectRootDir()` gets used while **generation time** (`make go-generate`) and resolves in the following way: use `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` (if set), otherwise default to `/app` (baked, as we can assume we are in the `development` container).
  - `/internal/util/(get_project_root_dir.go|get_project_root_dir_scripts.go)` is now introduced to automatically switch to the proper implementation based on the `// +build !scripts` or `// +build scripts` build tag, thus it's now consistent to import `util.GetProjectRootDir()`, especially while handler generation time (`make go-generate`).

## 2021-03-12
### Changed
- Upgrades to `golang@v1.16.2` (use `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Silence resolve of `GO_MODULE_NAME` if `go` was not found in path (typically host env related).

## 2021-03-11
### Added
- `make build` (`make go-build`) now sets `internal/config.ModuleName`, `internal/config.Commit` and `internal/config.BuildDate` via `-ldflags`.
  - `/-/version` (mgmt key auth) endpoint is now available, prints the same as `app -v`.
  - `app -v` is now available and prints out buildDate and commit. Sample:
```bash
app -v
github.com/majodev/go-beer-punk-proxy @ 19c4cdd0da151df432cd5ab33c35c8987b594cac (2021-03-11T15:42:27+00:00)
```
### Changed
- Upgrades to `golang@v1.16.1` (use `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Updates `google.golang.org/api@v0.41.0`, `github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype@v1.2.0` ([new supported formats](https://github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype/tree/v1.2.0)), `golang.org/x/sys`
- Removed `**/.git` from `.dockerignore` (`builder` stage) as we want the local git repo available while running `make go-build`.
- `app --help` now prominently includes the module name of the project. 
- Prominently recommend `make force-module-name` after running `make git-merge-go-starter` to fix all import paths.
## 2021-03-09
### Added
- Introduces `CHANGELOG.md`
### Changed
- `make git-merge-go-starter` now uses `--allow-unrelated-histories` by default.

  - See [FAQ: I want to compare or update my project/fork to the latest go-starter master.](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/FAQ#i-want-to-compare-or-update-my-projectfork-to-the-latest-go-starter-master)

## 2020-09-16
